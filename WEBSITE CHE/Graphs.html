        <h1>How has world population growth changed over time?</h1>
        <p>
        The world population has changed in dramatic ways over the last few centuries. Let’s take a look at 
        long-run data on population to understand this change, and how quickly the world population is growing today.
        </p>
        <p>
        The chart shows the increasing number of people living on our planet over the last 12,000 years. A mind-boggling 
        change: the world population today is around 2,000 times the size of what it was 12,000 ago when the world population
        was around 4 million – less than half of the current population of London.
        </p> 
        <p>What is striking about this chart is of
        course that almost all of this growth happened just very recently. Historical demographers estimate that around the year
        1800 the world population was only around 1 billion people. This implies that on average the population grew very slowly
        over this long time from 10,000 BCE to 1700 (by 0.04% annually). After 1800 this changed fundamentally: the world population 
        was around 1 billion in the year 1800 and is now, at around 8 billion, 8 times larger.</p> <p>Around 108 billion people have ever 
        lived on our planet. This means that today’s population size makes up 6.5% of the total number of people ever born.</p><p>
        For the long period from the appearance of modern Homo sapiens up to the starting point of this chart in 10,000 BCE it is 
        estimated that the total world population was often well under one million.2 In this period our species was often seriously threatened by extinction.
        </p>

        <h1>Other ways to visualize population growth</h1>
        <h3>How long did it take for the world population to double?</h3>
        <p>This visualization provides an additional perspective on population growth: the number of years it took to add one billion
        to the global population. This is based on the 2022 revision of world population estimates from the UN Population Division.</p>

        <p>This visualization shows again how the population growth rate has changed dramatically over time. It wasn’t until 1805 that
        the world reached its first billion; it then took another 120 years to reach two billion. By the third billion, this period
        had reduced to 35 years, reduced further to 14 years to reach four. The period of fastest growth occurred from 1974 to 2011,
        taking only 12 to 13 years to increase by one billion for the 5th, 6th, and 7th.</p>

        <p>The world has now surpassed this peak rate of growth, and the period between each billion is expected to continue to rise.
        It’s estimated to take approximately 14 years to reach nine billion in 2024, and a further 21 years to reach 10 billion in 2058.
        The latest UN medium projection expects that the world will not reach 11 billion people this century: it projects the population
        to peak at 10.4 billion in 2086 before falling again.</p>

        <h1>World Population Milestones</h1>
        <br>
        
        <h2>10 Billion (2058)</h2>
        <p>The United Nations projects world population will reach 10 billion in the year 2058.</p>
            
        <h2>9 Billion (2037)</h2>
        <p>World population is expected to reach 9 billion in the year 2037.</p>
        
        <h2>8.1 Billion (current)</h2>
        <p>The current world population is 8,071,580,189 as of Thursday, November 9, 2023 according to the most recent United Nations estimates [1] elaborated by Worldometer. The term "World Population" refers to the human population (the total number of humans currently living) of the world.</p>
        
        <h2>8 Billion (2022)</h2>
        <p>World population has reached 8 billion people on November 15, 2022 according to the United Nations. The U.S. Census Bureau International Database (IDB) estimates the world population will reach 8 billion in October 2023.</p>
        
        <h2>7 Billion (2010)</h2>
        <p>According to the latest revision by the United Nations (released in 2022), world population reached 7 Billion in late 2010 (after being previously estimated as occurring on October 31, 2011). The U.S. Census Bureau made a different estimate, for which the 7 billion mark was reached on March 12, 2012.</p>
        
        <h2>6 Billion (1998)</h2>
        <p>According to the latest revision by the United Nations (released in 2022), the 6 billion figure was reached towards the end of 1998 (this was previously estimated as occurring on October 12, 1999, celebrated as the Day of 6 Billion). According to the U.S. Census Bureau instead, the six billion milestone was reached on July 22, 1999, at about 3:49 AM GMT. Yet, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the date and time of when 6 billion was reached will probably change because the already uncertain estimates are constantly being updated.</p>
