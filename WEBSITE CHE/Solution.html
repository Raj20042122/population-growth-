            <h1>1. EMPOWERING WOMEN AND GIRLS</h1>
            <p>
                Where women and girls are empowered to choose what happens to their bodies and lives, fertility rates plummet.
                Empowerment means freedom to pursue education and a career, economic independence, easy access to sexual and
                reproductive healthcare, and ending horrific injustices like child marriage and gender-based violence. Overall,
                advancing the rights of women and girls is one of the most powerful solutions to our greatest environmental and
                social crises. Solutibelow are both tightly linked with female empowerment.

            <h1>2. QUALITY EDUCATION FOR ALL</h1>
            <p>
                Ensuring every child receives a quality education is one of the most effective levers for sustainable development.
                Many kids in developing countries are out of school, with girls affected more than boys due to gender inequality.
                Education opens doors and provides disadvantaged kids and young people with a “way out”. There is a direct 
                correlation between the number of years a woman spends in education and how many children she ends up having.
                According to one study, African women with no education have, on average, 5.4 children; women who have completed
                secondary school have 2.7 and those who have a college education have 2.2. When family sizes are smaller, that
                also empowers women to gain education, take work and improve their economic opportunities.<br>
                A UN survey showed that the more educated respondents were, the more likely they were to believe that there is a climate emergency.
                This means that higher levels of education lead to the election of politicians with stronger environmental policy agendas.

            <h1>3. REMOVING BARRIERS TO CONTRACEPTION</h1>  
            <p>
                Nearly half of all pregnancies are unintended. Currently, more than 200 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are 
                not using modern contraception. There are a variety of reasons for this, including lack of access, concerns about 
                side-effects and social pressure (often from male partners) not to use it.
            </p> 
            <p>
                These women mostly live in some of the world’s poorest countries, where population is set tbillion by 2100.
                Overseas aid support for family planning is essential – both ensuring levels are high enough and that delivery of
                service is effective and goes hand-in-hand with advancing gender equality and engaging men.
            </p>
            <p>
                Across the world, some people choose not to use contraception because they are influenced by assumptions, practices 
                and pressures within their nations or communities. In some places, very large family sizes are considered desirable;
                in others, the use of contraception is discouraged or forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Work with women and men to change attitudes towards contraception and family size has formed a key part of successful
                family planning programmes. Religious barriers may also be overturned or sidelined. In Iran in the 1980s, a very
                successful family planning campaign was initiated when the country’s religious leader declared the use of contraception
                was consistent with Islamic belief. In Europe, some predominantly Catholic countries such as Portugal and Italy have
                some of the lowest fertility rates.

            <h1>4. IMPROVING CHILD AND MATERNAL HEALTH</h1>   
            <p>
                Where children do not survive into adulthood, people tend to have larger families. Reducing infant and child mortality
                has been key to bringing birth rates down across the world. Family planning and gender equality helps to achive that,
                through allowing women to start having children when they are older and increase spacing between children. As family 
                size goes down, that also allows greater investment in health services, especially in low income countries.
