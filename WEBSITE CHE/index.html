            <h1><u>Population Growth</u></h1>
         </div>   
        <p>Population growth is the increase in the number of humans on Earth.
        For most of human history our population size was relatively stable.
        But with innovation and industrialization, energy, food, water, and medical care became more available and reliable.
        Consequently, global human population rapidly increased, and continues to do so, with dramatic impacts on global 
        climate and ecosystems. We will need technological and social innovation to help us support the world's population
        as we adapt to and mitigate climate and environmental changes.

    <h1 id="Our_growing_population">Our growing population</h1>
    <p>The world's population is more than three times larger than it was in the mid-twentieth century.
    The global human population reached 8.0 billion in mid-November 2022 from an estimated 2.5 billion people in 1950,
    adding 1 billion people since 2010 and 2 billion since 1998. The world's population is expected to increase by nearly 2 billion
    persons in the next 30 years, from the current 8 billion to 9.7 billion in 2050 and could peak at nearly 10.4 billion in the
    mid-2080s.</p>
    <p>This dramatic growth has been driven largely by increasing numbers of people surviving to reproductive age,
    the gradual increase in human lifespan, increasing urbanization, and accelerating migration. Major changes in fertility
    rate have accompanied this growth. These trends will have far-reaching implications for generations to come.</p>

    <h1 id="India_and_China">India and China : most populous countries</h1>
    <p>China (1.4 billion) and India (1.4 billion) remain the two most populous countries of the world, both with more than 1 billion
    people, each representing nearly 18 percent of the world's population, respectively. Around 2023, India is projected to overtake
    China as the world's most populous country, while China's population is projected to decrease by 48 million, or around 2.7 per cent,
    between 2019 and 2050.  (Sources: World Population Prospects 2022 and World Population Dashboard)</p>

            <h3><u>Fertility rates</u></h3>
            <p>Future population growth is highly dependent on the path that future fertility will take. According to the World 
            Population Prospects (2022 Revision), global fertility is projected to fall from 2.3 children per woman in 2021 to 2.1 in 2050.</p>

            <h3><u>Life expectancy</u></h3>
            <p>The number of years an average person in a country is expected to live. In Japan it's over 85 years while in the
            Central African Republic its around 53 years!</p>

            <h3><u>Migration</u></h3>
            <p>This is the movement of people (usually permanently) from one area to another. These people are referred to as migrants.
            When people move away
            (out-migration or emigration) it can cause a decrease in population. When migrants come into a country (in-migration or immigration)
            it increases population growth.</p>

            <h3><u>Birth rate</u></h3>
            <p>The number of births per 1000 people. A country with 30 births per 1000 people has a birth rate of (30/1000) x 100 = 3%.
            A young population and high fertility rate may cause birth rates to be high</p>

            <h3><u>Death rate</u></h3>
            <p>The number of deaths per 1000 people . To get the percentage that this represents you must divide by 10
            (which works out to be the same as the formula given for birth rate above). The age of the population and availability of
            health care impacts a country's death rate</p>

            <h3><u>Overpopulation</u></h3>
            <p>Refers to a situation where a country's resources are unable to meet the needs of its existing population. Countries facing such
            challenges are often forced to adopt 
            anti-natal policies such as mandatory birth control to curb population growth, such as the two-child policy in China.</p>

            <h1 id="Day_of_8_Billion"><u>Day of Eight Billion</u></h1>
            <p>On 15 November 2022, the world's population reached 8 billion people, a milestone in human development.
            While it took the global population 12 years to grow from 7 to 8 billion, it will take approximately 15 years until 2037
            for it to reach 9 billion, a sign that the overall growth rate of the global population is slowing. Yet levels of fertility
            remain high in some countries. Countries with the highest fertility levels tend to be those with the lowest income per capita.
            Global population growth has therefore over time become increasingly concentrated among the world's poorest countries,
            most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
